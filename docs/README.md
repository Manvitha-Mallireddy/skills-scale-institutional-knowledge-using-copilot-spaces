# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation. This repository centralizes all process knowledge to help teams deliver projects efficiently, consistently, and with clarity.

## Overview of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme employs a structured, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes clarity, collaboration, and continuous improvement. The project lifecycle is divided into well-defined phases: initiation, planning, execution and tracking, release and deployment, and retrospective. Each phase has specific deliverables and checklists that ensure no critical steps are missed, starting with validating business needs and stakeholder alignment during initiation, moving through actionable planning and risk identification, and culminating in release management and post-project reflection.

Core roles are central to the OctoAcme process. The Project Manager (PM) coordinates delivery, manages schedules, and facilitates communication, while the Product Manager (PdM) defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and drives product strategy. Developers are responsible for implementing features, writing tests, and collaborating on design and technical risks. QA professionals validate that deliverables meet acceptance criteria, and stakeholders provide input and approvals at key stages. Clear ownership is enforced, with each project having a named PM and Product Lead, and responsibilities for documentation, risk management, and reporting are explicitly assigned.

OctoAcme workflows leverage tools like project boards for work tracking, with structured columns (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, etc.) and a disciplined pull request (PR) process that mandates small, reviewable changes, issue linkage, and automated testing in CI. Quality assurance is multi-layered: unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are expected for critical flows, complemented by security scans and manual QA when required. Metrics such as velocity and burndown are tracked, and dashboards are used to monitor key signals like errors and usage. Communication is frequent and purposeful, with daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and regular stakeholder updates. Risks and blockers are discussed in team meetings, escalated according to severity, and logged in risk registers. Retrospectives drive continuous improvement, and action items from these sessions are incorporated into future planning.
